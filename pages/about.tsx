              Hi there, thank you for visiting my little news app. My name is
              <span className="inline-text"> TONY VU</span>, currently a proud
              Computer Programming and Analysis student at Seneca College
              majoring in
              <span className="inline-text"> Web Development</span> and{' '}
              <span className="inline-text">AI Technology</span>. Three words
              that define who I am:{' '}
              <span className="inline-text">Competent</span>,
              <span className="inline-text"> Hardworking</span>, and
              <span className="inline-text"> Efficient</span>. I do not believe
              in things that come easy in life, and hence always looking for
              challenges to improve myself. At the moment, I am seeking for a
              coop/internship opportunity to be part of important software
              projects built by great people.

            <p className="content">
              Before I started this journey in the world of technology, as a
              tech user I had always been wondered about how technology keeps
              the world running. Seneca's education has opened my eyes to a
              whole new world with no boundary. However, school materials are
              not enough to satisfy my thirst for knowledge, so I keep looking
              for new opportunities to learn either from well-known instructors
              or creating my own software. Now as a tech applicator, I am
              determined that one day I can master all the rules and practices
              in web development and AI technology to create useful applications
              that can help many people. <br /> <br />
              In my humble opinion, technology will continue to evolve and
              become indispensable to everyoneâ€™s life. There will be more and
              more opportunities to arise and I am dreaming of becoming a
              creator of new tech that can help others fulfil their dreams.
